Summer of LabVIEW revision of Endigit's SquareBattle

To get started writing a SquareBattle Team:
1. Browse to the Squares folder and copy the Template folder with a new name. Ideally the name should include your name and the team name you'll be creating.

2. Open the copied Square Template.lvproj in the copied folder and follow the remaining instructions in the readme included in the project.
