*** Do not edit any of the code in the dependencies in the project. If there is an issue in any code in the dependencies contact Derrick Bommarito. The Squares folder exists to ensure the provided examples get copied properly with the project. Feel free to look at these squares for implementation ideas!

1. To get started on the implementation, open the bookmark manager (View menu -> Bookmark Manager) and implement the code according to the notes.

2. The MyTeam instance already includes all the overrides available. More VIs can be added to the MyTeam to perform additional functionality as desired. As examples, the MyTeam class can perform functionality such as maintaining a map of squares, coordinating behaviors across squares, and keeping track of the location and team index of aggressive opponents.

3. The MySquare class is intended to be the first square placed on the battlefield but more classes can be implemented if desired to provide different behaviors. If you want to create another square, add a new class to the SquareTeam library that you renamed in (1) and have it inherit from the Square class (same as MySquare).

4. You can run the Launch SquareBattle VI to be able to run games with your square that is being developed and run it against other provided or downloaded square teams.
